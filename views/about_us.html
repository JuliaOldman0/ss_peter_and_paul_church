                <p>
                  Immediately prior to the entry of the United States into World
                  War I, the Russian residents of Elizabeth became increasingly
                  aware of the need for a Russian Orthodox Church in their city.
                  These recent immigrants were devout members of their Church.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1916, after several years of traveling as far as New York
                  City for regular church services, the group decided their
                  numbers were great enough to warrant the formation of a
                  Russian Orthodox Church in their city.
                </p>

              <h3 class="mb-3">The Growth of Our Church</h3>
              <p>
                The first pastor, Fr. Varchol, held services at several
                locations until 1918 when the parishioners purchased a former
                German Presbyterian Church at Third and Livingston Streets. This
                location was ideal as a majority of the parishioners resided in
                the immediate vicinity.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the very beginning, the societies of Ss. Boris & Gleb, Ss.
                Peter & Paul Mutual Aid Society, and the St. Mary Sisterhood
                contributed much to the steady growth of the parish. In 1941,
                the Elizabeth Russian Junior League, Chapter 132, of the
                F.R.O.C. was organized. The Altar Guild was established in 1949.

              <h3 class="mb-3">Building a New Church</h3>
              <p>
                Through the years, the energetic parishioners maintained and
                updated their facilities. In 1957, it became clear that a new
                church was needed, and a Building Fund program was established.
                In October 1961, property was purchased across town on Stiles
                Street, and actual construction began in April 1966.
              </p>
              <p>
                The church was consecrated on May 21, 1967, by Metropolitan
                John, Patriarchal Exarch of North and South America and the
                Aleutian Islands. That same year, Fr. Emil Minkovich arrived in
                October after graduating from Christ the Saviour Seminary.
              </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Parish Growth -->
            <div class="mt-4">
              <h3 class="mb-3">Continued Growth and Community</h3>
              <p>
                The year 1985 marked the burning of the church mortgage and the
                planning of a new parish Activity Center. Over time, we outgrew
                the original building, and in 1987, a new facility was built,
                including an auditorium, Sunday School rooms, a professional
                kitchen, an office for the pastor, and an apartment for the
                sexton.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1987, Fr. Emil Minkovich was elevated to the rank of Mitered
                Archpriest.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are now serving a fourth generation of parishioners. The
                parish, originally founded to serve Russian immigrants in
                Elizabeth, now welcomes Orthodox Christians from throughout
                central New Jersey, as well as recent immigrants from Russia.
                Our church choir provides musical inspiration, and the Sunday
                School ensures religious education for young parishioners.

              <p>
                In 1992, a Silver Anniversary celebration took place in honor of
                Fr. Emil Minkovich, our longest-serving pastor.
